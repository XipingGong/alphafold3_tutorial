    "This lecture note is prepared for MIBO 8110 to guide students in learning how to use AlphaFold 3 (AF3) for predicting biomolecular structures and interactions. It provides step-by-step instructions and practical examples to help students understand how AF3 integrates protein and small-molecule components into unified structure prediction workflows. The goal is to help students gain hands-on experience with computational structure prediction tools and appreciate their applications in molecular biology and bioinformatics research.\n"
