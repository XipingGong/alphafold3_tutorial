## 📘 Overview

You can read this Jupyter Notebook (`alphafold3.ipynb`) in the main directory, which is a hands-on tutorial to help you learn how to use AlphaFold 3 (AF3) to predict biomolecular structures and interactions. It provides a step-by-step workflow showing how you can use AF3 as a beginner.

## 🧩 Learning Objectives

By working through this notebook, you will learn how to:
- Predict **protein 3D structures** from amino acid sequences using AF3.  
- Predict **protein–ligand complexes** and explore binding interactions.  
- Calculate **RMSD** values and visualize predicted structures using **MDTraj** and **VMD**.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites and Setup

- **AlphaFold 3** must be installed.  
  Official GitHub: [https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold3](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold3)

- **Dependencies:**  
Some useful Python packages like `mdtraj`, `openmm`, and `biopython` need to be preinstalled.
